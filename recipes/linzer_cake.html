        Considered to be the oldest cake in the world, Linzer Torte is a true Austrian classic. It's often served with a big dollop of whipped cream and dusted with confectioners' sugar.</p>

            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>Lots of ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>A pinch of ground cloves</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Grated lemon rind or lemon juice</li>
            <li>Wafers for layering, to taste</li>
            <li>Egg for coating</li>
            <li>Redcurrant jam for coating</li>

            <li>Flaked almonds, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to make it</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a pile of flour on the work surface, slice the butter into cubes, and rub between the fingers into the flour to create a light crumb. Flavour with the cinnamon, a pinch of ground cloves and a little salt, together with the lemon rind or lemon juice and ground nuts. Work quickly to <strong>form a smooth short pastry</strong>, shape into a ball, cover with cling film, and leave to rest in a cool place for approx. 30 minutes.</li> </br>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to <strong>180°C / 356°F</strong>. Grease a suitably sized spring form cake tin and then <strong>dust with the bread crumbs</strong> to prevent the dough from sticking.</li> </br>
            <li>Now press <strong>a little over half of the dough onto the base of the tin</strong> using your knuckles. Shape the remaining dough into several small rolls (for the lattice) and one thicker roll (for the edge). If you like, cover the pastry base with wafers, and then coat with smoothly stirred jam, leaving about 1 cm / 0.4 inch all around for the edge. Place the thicker roll into the tin as an edging, and press down gently. Use the thinner rolls to create a lattice. Sprinkle with flaked almonds to taste.</li> </br>
            <li>Coat the dough with the beaten egg and bake in the pre-heated oven for <strong>50 – 60 minutes</strong>. Take out the tart, leave to cool, and ideally leave to stand for a day, wrapped in cling film. Dust with icing sugar.</li>
        </ol>
